## 2026-11-02 — Binary inspection and format-registry foundation

### Goal
Begin the native/proprietary engine research track with generic, read-only executable and container inspection. The aim is to make Ramen capable of collecting evidence about difficult engine families before designing a runtime.

### Changed in this PR
- Added `BinaryArtifactInspector` under the `inspection` package.
- Added bounded PE header inspection: DOS PE offset, PE signature, COFF machine, optional-header kind, section count, and DLL flag.
- Added first-byte signature recognition for ELF, ZIP, RIFF, Ogg, PNG, and JPEG.
- Added `ContainerFormatRegistry` with separate verified-signature and extension-only evidence lists.
- Added unit tests for PE32/x86, PE32+/ARM64 DLL, ZIP/Ogg, unknown extension, malformed MZ, and registry evidence separation.
- Added engine-research and format-registry documents.
- Updated README, architecture, compatibility notes, and roadmap to make this the current development track.

### Evidence captured
Screenshots supplied in chat showed repeated `.gpk/.gtb` and `.vpk/.vtb` filenames, `.xtx` files, an executable, and several DLL names. These are filename-level observations only. No binary bytes were available in the repository, so no proprietary format has been identified or decoded.

### Explicitly not implemented
- No EXE execution, emulation, or runtime launch.
- No proprietary archive parser or decompressor.
- No script VM.
- No PE import-table or version-resource parsing yet.
- No claim of support for the observed extension families.

### Next steps
1. Implement a bounded PE import-directory reader and list imported DLLs.
2. Add an incremental SHA-256 inventory.
3. Introduce a generic read-only random-access source interface.
4. Add a container-probe interface with `MATCH`, `NO_MATCH`, and `MALFORMED` outcomes.
5. Add synthetic test fixtures for malformed headers and integer-overflow boundaries.
